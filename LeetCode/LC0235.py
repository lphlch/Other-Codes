给定一个二叉搜索树, 找到该树中两个指定节点的最近公共祖先。

百度百科中最近公共祖先的定义为：“对于有根树 T 的两个结点 p、q，最近公共祖先表示为一个结点 x，满足 x 是 p、q 的祖先且 x 的深度尽可能大（一个节点也可以是它自己的祖先）。”

235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
